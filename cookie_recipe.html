        <h4>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</h4>
        <h4>2 large eggs</h4>
        <h4>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</h4>

        <h4>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</h4>
        <h4>a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</h4>
        <h4>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</h4>
        <h4>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</h4>
        <h4>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</h4>
        <h4>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</h4>
